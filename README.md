Everyone always wants the last word in on something, or in this case the last clap. Youâ€™ve most likely been that person before who always battles with someone for the last clap in a presentation. Now you can forever battle out your fellow classmates for the final clap, but you don't have to just fight for it in school. You can take pride in knowing you got the final clap in wonderful locations such as a movie theater, a Commercial Airline, and a funeral home! Every celebration has to at least have one person who wants in, just make sure you keep suspicion to a minimum or risk being thrown out.

Four fun, filled levels with multiple AI to increase the competition!
